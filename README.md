# AUTOMATING PROJECT CREATION PROCESS (bonus installs django creates a django project in a virtual env )

##### Before we using it you will need to have the [GIT BASH](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git Bash download") and [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python download")  installed


1. OPEN THE CREATE.sh put in the directory you want the project created and also your github username ##### Note if you intend to also create a django project standard django naming conventions apply ( no - allowed)
2. OPEN THE CREATE.PY and also put in the directory you want the project created and also [github token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token "Git Bash download") to login
3. Thats it run `./create.sh` command on bash and you're good


## Its best to use env variables for token,project paths, and git username .. much safer
